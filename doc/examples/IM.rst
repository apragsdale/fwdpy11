Isolation-with-migration (IM)
===================================================================

This example uses :func:`fwdpy11.demographic_models.IM.two_deme_IM` to run
simulations of an IM model and compare the results to the output of
moments_ [Jouganous2017]_, which calculates the expected mutation
frequency spectrum using diffusion approximations.

The goal of the script is to get the expected frequency spectrum (``FS``)
for a sample taken from each deme.  We do this in two ways:

* We get the mean ``FS`` for each entire deme and then project it down
  to the ``FS`` for the desired sample size.
* We get the mean ``FS`` for the desired sample size.

The final output is a figure showing the expectation obtained from ``moments``
and the two mean ``FS`` from ``fwdpy11``.  The figure shows the expectation
separately for both demes.

This script is a "deep dive" into this kind of modeling.  First,
we have to deal with how the model parameters are scaled, and the
fact that ``fwdpy11`` does things differently from ``moments``.  The 
difference between the two programs is especially tricky for the migration
rates, and we need to reverse their order when using ``momments`` to
get the expected frequency spectra.

   Example output from this script, generated by the command line
   show below.  This simulation does not involve any mutations
   affecting fitness.  Deme 0 splits equally into demes 0 and 1 0.3
   time units ago.  The two demes grow to 2 and 3 time the 
   ancestral population size, respectively, and migration
   between demes is asymmetric.
