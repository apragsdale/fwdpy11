    "# Conceptual overview of tree sequence recording\n",
    "\n",
    "`fwdpy11` 0.2.0 added support for tree sequence recording (`TSR`),\n",
    "which is a method to both speed up forward-time simulations and to\n",
    "track the entire genealogical history of the simulation.\n",
    "The key reference describing `TSR` is {cite}`Kelleher2016-cb`, which in turn relies\n",
    "heavily on concepts described in {cite}`Kelleher2016-cb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of `TSR` is to track a set of tables that contain the trees describing the ancestry of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trees and tables\n",
    "\n",
    "To start out, let us consider the following tree:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure-md}\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/tree.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree with seven nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This tree is the \"marginal\" history of a genomic segment covering the half-open interval {math}`[l, r)`. In other words,\n",
    "all genomic positions in this interval have the same ancestry, and recombination results in different intervals having\n",
    "different trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following {cite}`Kelleher2016-cb`, we can represent the above tree using two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure-md}\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/tables.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The node and edges tables corresponding to Fig 1.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "We learn two things from Fig 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Node tables track the birth times of nodes.  Here, we measure time as increasing from past to the present.\n",
    "2. Edge tables record the transmissions of genomic intervals from parents to children.  The parent/child fields\n",
    "   are indexes of the node table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge tables have specific sorting requirements.  The sorting is nested:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decreasing order of parent birth times (as we read the table from top to bottom).\n",
    "2. For edges with the same parent, child indexes are sorted in increasing order\n",
    "3. Finally, edges are sorted by increasing left position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relating an evolving populaton to node and edge tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of a diploid Wright-Fisher population.  There are {math}`N` individuals, and\n",
    "thus {math}`2N` haploid genomes.  Define a genome as all of the genomic intervals inherited from a\n",
    "single parent.  Positions along the genome have values from the interval {math}`[0,L)`, and we do not\n",
    "care if positions take on continuous or discrete values within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time point, we may describe the population as consisting of {math}`2N` nodes with integer labels\n",
    "{math}`[i,i+2N)`.  Our diploids are then defined as adjacent tuples of nodes,\n",
    "{math}`D \\in [(i,i+1),(i+2,i+3),\\ldots,(i+2N-2,i+2N-1)]`.  Node labels thus represent haploid genomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the next generation, offspring are generated by recording which intervals they inherit from which parental\n",
    "nodes.  These intervals are determined by the usual rules of evolving a Wright-Fisher model with selection and\n",
    "recombination.  We record these transmission events as *edges*, which we may describe as tuples `(left, right, parent,\n",
    "child)`. In words, such a tuple means \"Parental node label `parent` transmitted the genomic interval\n",
    "{math}`[left,right)` to offspring node label `child`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of a forward simulation is to record new nodes and edges as they arise.  The simulation ends up recording many\n",
    "transmission events that quickly go extinct.  The simplification algorithm described in the 2018 paper mentioned above\n",
    "takes this \"messy\" node and edge table and returns \"simplified\" node and edge tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize this process using an example taken from the `tskit` [tutorials][tutorials], which implements the discrete-time\n",
    "Wright-Fisher model for a diploid population without recombination and without selection:"
